                    David Robert Jones (born 8 January 1947, died 10 January 2016), known professionally as David Bowie,
                     was an English singer, songwriter and actor. He was a leading figure in the music industry and is 
                     often considered to be one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century, acclaimed by critics 
                     and fellow musicians, particularly for his innovative work during the 1970s. His career was marked by 
                     reinvention and visual presentation, with his music and stagecraft having a significant impact on popular 
                     music. During his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at 140 million albums worldwide, made him one of the 
                     world's best-selling music artists. In the UK, he was awarded ten platinum album certifications, eleven gold and 
                     eight silver, releasing eleven number-one albums. In the US, he received five platinum and nine gold certifications. 
                     He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996.

                    Born in Brixton, South London, Bowie developed an interest in music as a child, eventually studying art, 
                    music, and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. "Space Oddity" became his first top-five 
                    entry on the UK Singles Chart after its release in July 1969. After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during 
                    the glam rock era with his flamboyant and androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust. The character was spearheaded by the success 
                    of his single "Starman" and album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, which won him widespread popularity.
                    In 1975, Bowie's style shifted radically towards a sound he characterised as "plastic soul", initially alienating many of his UK devotees
                    but garnering him his first major US crossover success with the number-one single "Fame" and the album Young Americans. In 1976, Bowie starred 
                    in the cult film The Man Who Fell to Earth, directed by Nicolas Roeg, and released Station to Station. The following year, he further confounded 
                    musical expectations with the electronic-inflected album Low (1977), the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno that would come to be known 
                    as the "Berlin Trilogy". "Heroes" (1977) and Lodger (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.
